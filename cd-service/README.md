# Continuous Deployment Service Documentation
The Continuous Deployment Service is responsible for automating the deployment process of applications in the Persys Cloud platform. This service provides a scalable and efficient way to deploy applications to different environments such as development, staging, and production.

## Endpoints
The Continuous Deployment Service does not expose any HTTP endpoints. Instead, it uses a custom Watermill Kafka event controller to listen for events. The event controller loop listens for Kafka messages generated by the /events-manager service.
